# Landing Page Project

The project is about changing a static Landing web page into a dynamic one.
This is achieved by using HTML and CSS for the static part.
After building the basics by HTML and CSS they are later manipulated by *JavaScript*, or we can say Manipulating the **DOM** with JavaScript.
The dynamics included in the page is mostly navigational.
There is a number of sections that contain some text, each section gets highlighted when it's under view.
Also there is a __navagation bar__ at the top of the page contains all the sections in the page.
We can simply and smoothly leap between those sections by clicking on them in that Navagation Bar.
Don't worry, you won't get lost in the sections ,because you gonna find your section always marked in the navagation bar for you.

## Instructions

1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Scroll throught the sections.
3. try clicking the section in the white Navagational Bar at the top.
4. Hopefully, Enjoy reviewing my first project ever. *Yaaaay!*.
